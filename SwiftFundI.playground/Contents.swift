//: # Swift Fundamentals I
//: ## Hello, World!
//: As tradition dictates, any exploration of a new language needs to start with "hello, world"

print("Hello, World!")

//: ## Comments
//: A comment is text that is ignored by the compiler. So it can be plain text, or even code. If it formatted like the examples below, it will be completely ignored when the project is built. Comments are notes to yourself or others about how a given block of code functions.

// A single line comment is one with two slashes as the first characters
/*
 * A multi-line comment
 * is one that is bounded by
 * /* and */ characters
 */

//: ## Identifiers
//: first character A-Z or a-z or _, followed by any of these plus 0-9

let lambdaSchool = "Awesome"

//: ## Mutability
//: There are two kinds of containers that hold values in Swift. One kind is called a constant, because once a value has been set, it cannot change for the lifetime of that container. Constants are declared with the `let` keyword.

let name = "Tyler"

//: Variables are declared with the 'var' keyword
var myName = "Tyler"
myName = "Shawn"


//: ## Type Inference and Explicit Typing
//: All containers in Swift must have a type set on them. The containers we've seen so far had their types set implicitly. This is called _type inference_. Meaning the kind of object stored in the container was determined by looking at what kind of value was assigned to the container.

// Without Type Inference
var myNumber: Int = 10
// Type Inferencel
let ios = "Apple's mobile operating system"


//: In the line above, the constant `ios` stores a value "Apple's mobile operating system". This value is a `String`, so the data type of `ios` is `String`. The type was _inferred_ by the value provided.
//: Another way to type a container is to set it explicitly. See some examples of this below.

var onSale:Bool = true


//: ## Type Safety
//: Once a container's data type is set, it cannot hold a value of any other type



//: ## Type Coercion
//: Types are never automatically converted into another type.



//: ## String Interpolation and Concatenation
//: Using the `+` operator with two strings is called _string concatentation_. One string is appended to the end of another.



//: The below example shows the _string interpolation_ characters (`\()`). These allow a `String` (or non-string) value to be placed in-line inside a larger `String` literal value. If the value is not already a `String`, it will be converted.



//: ## Collections
//: ### Arrays
//: A Swift array is a collection of like objects, and they are stored in the order they are added. Accessing a particular element is done by using its index value (which starts at 0).



//: Array equality is determined by looking at each element. If all elements are the same, and in the same order, the two arrays are equal.



//: Since `shipCaptains` was declared as a constant, we must convert it to a mutable array before we can add entries.



//: ### Dictionaries
//: A Swift dictionary is similar to an array in that is a collection, but the items are stored in no particular order. To access an item, its associated key is provided. Dictionaries are also called "key-value" stores. The key has a type, and the value can have the same or a different type.



//: ## Looping
//: ### `for`
//: `for` loops allow for iterating over a collection of elements (usually an array), examining each element in turn.



//: ### `switch`
//: `switch` statements are useful when a multiple-choice path is possible for your code, and you want to choose a single path at runtime, based on some criteria.



//: ## Functions
//: A function in Swift is nothing more than a collection of instructions that accomplish some task. The advantage to grouping the instructions into a function is that the function can then be called whenever that task should be performed, rather than having to list out those instrutions a second, third, or nth time.



//: ## Tuples
//: Tuples are a lightweight way of grouping related values into a single compound value.
